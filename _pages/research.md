## [Reliable AI for Autonomous surgical robotic assistants](https://www.mein.nagoya-u.ac.jp/en/medical_autonomous_surgical_assistant_robot.html)
Part of the CREST Project "Reliable Interventional AI Robotics sharing its ambiguity of AI diagnosis with medical profession" (2021 - Today)
Our goal is to develop an autonomous surgical assistant robot that leverages reliable AI strategies, computer vision, and human-robot interactive communication and intention prediction to assist surgeons in complex procedures.



## [Human-robot interfaces for cooperative surgical robots](http://www.mein.nagoya-u.ac.jp/en/medical_user_interface_cooperative_surgery.html)
Part of the IMPACT Project "SmartArm - Bionic Humanoids Propelling New Industrial Revolution".
We developed human-robot interfaces for intuitive and dexterous control of a bimanual surgical robots based on industrial arms and multi-DOFs flexible surgical instruments.
