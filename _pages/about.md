I am a Postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Micro-Nano Mechanical Science and Engineering, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan. I work in the [Intelligent Robotics and Biomechatronics Laboratory](https://www.mein.nagoya-u.ac.jp/), where I design and develop smart systems that can assist humans in various domains. My research interests include assistive technologies, medical robotics and physical human-robot interaction.

I have a a B.Sc. in Electronics Engineering from the [National University of Engineering](https://www.uni.edu.pe/). I obtained my masterâ€™s and doctoral degrees in Micro-Nano Mechanical Science and Engineering from [Nagoya University](https://en.nagoya-u.ac.jp/) in Japan, where I conducted research on human-robot interfaces, development of robotic surgical devices, constrained motion planning, haptic devices, and autonomous surgical assistance.

I am passionate about advancing the field of intelligent assistive systems and contributing to the well-being of society through my research. I am always eager to learn new skills and collaborate with other researchers who share my vision. If you are interested in my work or want to get in touch with me, please feel free to contact me via email or any of the social media platforms listed on my website.
